# Font description from a string representation in the form
# [FAMILY-LIST] [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE] [VARIATIONS]  

# FAMILY-LIST is a comma-separated list of families optionally terminated by a comma,

# STYLE_OPTIONS is a whitespace-separated list of words where each word describes one of style, variant, weight, stretch, or gravity, 
# style understands"Normal", "Roman", "Oblique", "Italic".
# variant understands "Small-Caps".
# weights: "Thin", "Ultra-Light", "Extra-Light", "Light", "Semi-Light", "Demi-Light", "Book", "Regular", "Medium", "Semi-Bold", "Demi-Bold", "Bold", "Ultra-Bold", 
# "Extra-Bold", "Heavy", "Black", "Ultra-Black", "Extra-Black".
# stretch values: "Ultra-Condensed", "Extra-Condensed", "Condensed", "Semi-Condensed", "Semi-Expanded", "Expanded", "Extra-Expanded", "Ultra-Expanded".
# gravity values: "Not-Rotated", "South", "Upside-Down", "North", "Rotated-Left", "East", "Rotated-Right", "West".

# SIZE is a decimal number (size in points) or optionally followed by the unit modifier "px" for absolute size. 

# VARIATIONS is a comma-separated list of font variation specifications of the form "@axis=value" (the = sign is optional).

# Any one of the options may be absent.
# If FAMILY-LIST is absent, then the family_name field of the resulting font description will be initialized to NULL.
# If STYLE-OPTIONS is missing, then all style options will be set to the default values.
# If SIZE is missing, the size in the resulting font description will be set to 0.

# A typical example:
# "Cantarell Italic Light 15 @wght=200"
